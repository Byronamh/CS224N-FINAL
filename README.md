## Abstract
The inner workings of job search engines like [Linkedin](Linkedin.com) and [Indeed.com](https://www.indeed.com/) have always peaked my interest. How do they find jobs that are suited for the user? What skills makes a user ideal for a specific job? In this paper, NLP, CNN and NER are used to extract data from resumes, train a model and finally match the best potential jobs, giving an insight on how enterprise solutions might be built.

## Introduction
Nowadays, there are many job search engines that require minimal user data, just an updated resume. These search engines have methods to extract your work, education and general expertise from your uploaded resumes. Additionally, whenever you search for a job without a description or title (using Linkedin), it will automatically find potential job interests in the área you defined (if you didn't, it does a world wide search!).
